The newest version of OpenAI's language model system, GPT-4, was officially launched on March 13, 2023 with a paid subscription allowing users access to the Chat GPT-4 tool. As of this writing, full access to the model’s capabilities remains limited, and the free version of ChatGPT still uses the GPT-3.5 model.Overall, GPT-4 seems more functional, responsive and safer than GPT-3 or GPT-3.5. Still, with Microsoft’s Bing Chat using the GPT-4 language model, and the company facing many complaints and criticism about some of Bing Chat’s strange responses, it’s fair to say that these limitations dampen any expectation of GPT-4 being an out-of-the-box “revolution.”
